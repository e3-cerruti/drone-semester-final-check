# CoDrone EDU Final Exam Pre-Check

Welcome to your e3 Civic High Computer Science final exam check!


## What to Do
1. **Open this project in Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Open `check.py` and read the instructions in the comments.**
3. **Complete all the TODO sections by writing your own code where indicated.**
4. **Save your changes.**
5. **Make sure you are using the `.venv` virtual environment** (already included, no setup needed).
6. **Run `check.py`** by right-clicking the file and selecting "Run Python File in Terminal" or by using the terminal:
   ```sh
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python check.py
   ```
7. **Check that your code works and the output makes sense.**
8. **Commit your changes and push to GitHub Classroom** when you are done.

## Important Notes
- The `.venv` folder is included so you have the correct `codrone-edu` library. You do NOT need to install anything.
- If you see errors about missing libraries, make sure you activated the virtual environment.
- If you have any issues, ask your teacher for help.

## Why This?
This check makes sure your computer is ready for the CoDrone EDU final exam and that you can use the right Python tools with no extra setup.

Good luck! 🚁
